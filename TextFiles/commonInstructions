Now I'm going to upload many Chairs in batches, i'll tell you when all are uploaded. As i upload, analyze each piece for its Silhouette & Form, Materials & Finish, Color Palette, Era & Style, Tags. And save these info together with the image itself into your directory for later use.

Later on i might ask you, for example, tell me about FILENAME, then you need to display me the image, and tell me all the analysis.

Generate and list the top 20 "dream room" combos. If you are using any inventory item, use the filename, if you are using any external item make sure to write down a detailed and accurate and easily searchable name.

Please note that we can always customize a piece's material/color/pattern/size (mainly for upholstery), if needed, write down the custimization detail.

Pick:  1. A pedant or an art work above headboard  2. Two ascent chairs, in different styles but with harmony  3. An optional side light (floor lamp, pedant, wall light)  4. An optional coffee table or a side table near chairs, with an optional lamp on it  5. 1 or 2 tanle lamp for nightstands.

Goal 1. Blend Chic French, Mid-Century Modern, Sculptural Contemporary, Natural Materials, Vintage Collectible, and Luxury. So the items in the room should be diversified in culture and era.

Goal 2. The pieces should still be in harmony, echoing or having dialogue with each other or part the room, and the whole room should be telling a story.
